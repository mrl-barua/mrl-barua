# üí´ About Me:
Hello, I am Marlo Barua. Just call me Marls. I am an Information Technology student and an aspiring Full Stack developer. Currently, I specialize in Frontend Technology in Web Development, but I also have experience as a full-stack developer with a tech stack of Vue for the front end and Laravel for the back end. In my current project, I am focusing on being a Game Designer and Developer using Godot 4 as a game engine, employing GDscript and C++ as its core languages.<br><be>

And if you happen to have any problems related to frontend technology, please feel free to contact me. Maybe I can help, or perhaps we can find a solution together.


P.S. Most of my personal projects are private, so if you want access to those repositories, please contact me anytime. :>
